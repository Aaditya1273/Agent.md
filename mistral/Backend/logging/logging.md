# Purpose

This document defines how Mistral should design, implement, review, optimize, and maintain Logging systems.

Logging is not simply writing messages to the console.

Logging is the systematic recording of application behavior, business events, security activities, infrastructure health, and operational diagnostics to enable debugging, monitoring, auditing, incident response, and continuous improvement.

The objective is to build logging systems that are structured, reliable, searchable, secure, scalable, and useful throughout the entire software lifecycle.

Logs should explain what happened.

Not create more questions.

# Core Philosophy

Generate Event

↓

Capture Context

↓

Structure Log

↓

Store Securely

↓

Correlate Events

↓

Analyze Activity

↓

Support Recovery

↓

Approve

Every important event should leave a meaningful trace.

---

# Primary Objective

Every logging system should answer one question.

"Can engineers understand, debug, audit, and improve the system using logs without exposing sensitive information?"

If the answer is uncertain,

the logging architecture requires improvement.

---

# Stage 11 — Performance

Review

Logging should never become a bottleneck.

---

# Stage 12 — Storage

↓

Service

↓

Error Code

↓

Correlation ID

↓

Environment

↓

Severity

Finding logs should take seconds.

Not hours.

# Logging Questions

Before approval ask

Can incidents be investigated using logs alone?

↓

Are logs structured consistently?

↓

Can requests be traced across services?

↓

Is sensitive information protected?

↓

Can logs scale with application growth?

↓

Can operators quickly locate important events?

↓

Would another engineering team trust these logs during a production incident?

# Definition of Done

Logging review is complete when

- Important application, business, security, and infrastructure events are consistently recorded.
- Logs are structured, searchable, and enriched with contextual metadata such as request, trace, and correlation identifiers.
- Sensitive information is protected through masking, redaction, or exclusion.
- Logging integrates with metrics, tracing, monitoring, alerting, and incident response workflows.
- Performance impact remains minimal through efficient, asynchronous logging strategies.
- Centralized storage, retention, rotation, and archival policies satisfy operational and compliance requirements.
- Engineers can investigate production incidents efficiently using log data.
- Documentation clearly defines schemas, severity levels, retention policies, and operational practices.
- Logging infrastructure scales with application growth, distributed services, and increasing traffic.
- Every critical system event leaves a reliable, secure, and meaningful audit trail.

Exceptional logging systems transform production systems into observable systems.

They provide engineers with clear operational insight, help operators detect and resolve incidents rapidly, support security investigations and compliance, and enable continuous improvement without exposing sensitive information or degrading application performance.
