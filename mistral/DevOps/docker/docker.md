# Purpose

This document defines engineering principles, architectural guidance, operational standards, and best practices for designing, building, securing, optimizing, and operating applications using Docker.

It applies to

- Backend Services
- Frontend Applications
- APIs
- Databases
- Worker Services
- AI Applications
- Microservices
- Enterprise Platforms
- Cloud Infrastructure

Docker is not virtualization.

Docker is application packaging.

Containers should make software deployment predictable, reproducible, portable, and operationally consistent across every environment.

A container should behave identically on every machine.

# Definition of Done

A Docker architecture is considered production-ready when

- Every application is packaged into reproducible, deterministic, immutable container images that behave consistently across development, testing, staging, and production environments.
- Dockerfiles are intentionally designed using trusted base images, optimized layer ordering, minimal dependencies, efficient caching strategies, and reproducible build processes.
- Containers execute with least-privilege principles, avoid unnecessary capabilities, protect sensitive information, and satisfy organizational security and compliance requirements.
- Runtime configuration, secrets, environment variables, networking, storage, and service discovery remain externalized and environment-specific without requiring image modifications.
- Health checks, restart strategies, graceful shutdown procedures, monitoring, logging, and recovery mechanisms ensure resilient production operation.
- Images are continuously scanned for vulnerabilities, versioned, tested, reviewed, published, and deployed through automated engineering workflows.
- Containerized workloads scale predictably across infrastructure while maintaining operational consistency, performance efficiency, and business reliability.
- Documentation preserves architectural decisions, operational procedures, deployment strategies, recovery workflows, security practices, and long-term maintenance guidance.
- Engineering reviews continuously validate portability, security, scalability, maintainability, observability, operational excellence, and production readiness.
- The Docker platform consistently demonstrates deterministic builds, reproducible deployments, operational simplicity, infrastructure portability, engineering discipline, and long-term sustainability.

Exceptional Docker architectures are almost invisible.

Developers focus on building software instead of configuring environments, operations teams deploy confidently because every image is deterministic, infrastructure behaves consistently across every platform, failures recover predictably, and software delivery becomes a reliable engineering process rather than an environment-specific challenge.
