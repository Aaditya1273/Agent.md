- Production Software

CSRF protection is not adding a hidden token to forms.

CSRF protection is the engineering discipline of ensuring that every state-changing request originates intentionally from an authenticated and trusted user within the expected security context while preventing unauthorized cross-origin request execution.

CSRF answers one question:

**Did this authenticated user intentionally perform this action from a trusted context?**

# Definition of Done

A CSRF protection strategy is considered complete when

- Protected operations, browser trust boundaries, session management, request validation mechanisms, cookie policies, monitoring capabilities, governance processes, and operational controls have been systematically designed using secure engineering principles and evidence-based methodologies.
- Every state-changing request is independently validated using multiple defensive mechanisms that verify request authenticity, preserve session integrity, prevent cross-origin request forgery, and maintain reliable protection throughout the software lifecycle.
- The protection architecture supports scalable distributed systems, secure browser behavior, maintainable engineering practices, continuous monitoring, operational resilience, sustainable governance, and long-term software evolution without introducing unnecessary complexity or technical debt.
- Engineering reviews validate request validation consistency, session protection, browser compatibility, documentation completeness, maintainability, scalability, production readiness, operational resilience, auditability, and long-term engineering sustainability before deployment.
- Documentation clearly explains browser trust boundaries, request validation strategy, session architecture, cookie policies, engineering rationale, governance expectations, operational procedures, validation evidence, trade-offs, and future CSRF improvements.
- CSRF protection decisions remain implementation-independent, vendor-neutral, measurable, reproducible, evidence-based, and applicable across evolving browser platforms, web architectures, cloud infrastructure, and future web security technologies.
- The resulting application demonstrates engineering discipline, strong request authenticity, resilient browser security, predictable validation behavior, operational excellence, maintainability, scalability, continuous observability, and sustainable software security throughout its lifetime.

Exceptional CSRF protection is not measured by the number of security tokens implemented.

It is measured by how reliably software verifies user intent, protects authenticated sessions from unauthorized cross-origin actions, minimizes browser trust abuse, withstands evolving web security threats, and continuously delivers secure, maintainable, and resilient request validation throughout the lifetime of the software.
