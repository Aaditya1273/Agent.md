Lazy loading is not delaying everything.

Lazy loading is the engineering discipline of loading resources only when they become necessary, ensuring that computation, network usage, memory consumption, and execution time remain proportional to actual user demand.

Efficient software performs meaningful work only when meaningful work is required.

# Definition of Done

A lazy loading strategy is considered complete when

- Resources are loaded according to actual user demand, business priority, and application behavior while preserving correctness, responsiveness, accessibility, maintainability, and architectural integrity.
- Critical functionality remains immediately available, while non-critical resources are intentionally deferred through measurable engineering decisions that reduce unnecessary computation, memory usage, network activity, and execution overhead.
- Loading architecture supports scalability, reliability, component isolation, operational stability, predictable dependency management, and future application growth without introducing unnecessary complexity or technical debt.
- Engineering reviews validate loading behavior, dependency relationships, performance characteristics, recovery mechanisms, documentation quality, maintainability, scalability, accessibility, and production readiness before deployment.
- Documentation clearly explains loading boundaries, prioritization decisions, dependency analysis, engineering trade-offs, validation evidence, known constraints, governance expectations, and future optimization opportunities.
- Loading decisions remain measurable, deterministic, implementation-independent, reproducible, and aligned with sustainable engineering principles rather than framework-specific implementation techniques.
- The resulting system demonstrates engineering discipline, efficient resource utilization, responsive user experience, architectural clarity, predictable behavior, maintainability, operational excellence, and long-term software sustainability.

Exceptional lazy loading is not measured by how many resources are deferred.

It is measured by how intelligently software delivers the right resources at the right time while performing no unnecessary work, preserving responsiveness, minimizing resource consumption, and enabling sustainable engineering as the application continues to evolve.
