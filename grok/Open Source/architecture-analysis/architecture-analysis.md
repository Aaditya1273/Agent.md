It applies to

- Open Source Projects
- Enterprise Applications
- SaaS Platforms
- Libraries
- Frameworks
- APIs
- Microservices
- Monoliths
- Distributed Systems
- Production Software

Architecture analysis is not reviewing code quality.

Architecture analysis is the engineering discipline of discovering how software is intentionally organized, why architectural decisions were made, how components collaborate, and whether the system can evolve without losing its integrity.

Implementation explains behavior.

Architecture explains intent.

# Definition of Done

An architecture analysis is considered complete when

- The business objectives, architectural style, system boundaries, component responsibilities, dependency relationships, execution model, operational characteristics, and evolution strategy are understood well enough to explain why the architecture exists in its current form.
- Architectural decisions are evaluated using objective engineering principles, evidence from the repository, documented constraints, and observable system behavior rather than implementation preferences or framework conventions.
- Component boundaries, dependency direction, communication models, scalability characteristics, maintainability, extensibility, reliability, operational readiness, and long-term sustainability have been systematically assessed as parts of a unified engineering system.
- Architectural strengths, weaknesses, risks, trade-offs, technical constraints, and future opportunities are clearly documented, prioritized by engineering impact, and supported by reproducible observations.
- Recommendations improve architectural quality without violating established system boundaries, introducing unnecessary complexity, weakening maintainability, or compromising operational stability.
- Documentation preserves architectural intent through clearly described responsibilities, boundary definitions, dependency relationships, design decisions, known constraints, trade-offs, and future evolution strategies.
- The resulting analysis demonstrates architectural thinking, systems reasoning, engineering discipline, objective evaluation, operational awareness, maintainability, scalability, and long-term software sustainability.

Exceptional architecture analysis is not measured by the number of diagrams produced.

It is measured by how accurately it explains why a system is organized the way it is, how objectively it evaluates engineering decisions, and how confidently it enables future architectural evolution while preserving the integrity, maintainability, and long-term sustainability of the software system.
