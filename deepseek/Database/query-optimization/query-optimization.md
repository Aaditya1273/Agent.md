# Purpose

This document defines engineering principles, architectural guidance, operational standards, and best practices for designing, analyzing, optimizing, and maintaining high-performance database queries.

It applies to

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- SQL Server
- Oracle
- CockroachDB
- SQLite
- Distributed SQL Databases

Query optimization is not making SQL shorter.

Query optimization is designing database interactions that deliver correct business results with the minimum possible computational cost.

Fast queries improve systems.

Predictable queries build reliable systems.

# Definition of Done

A query optimization strategy is considered production-ready when

- Every query consistently returns correct business results while minimizing computational cost, storage access, memory consumption, and network overhead.
- Execution plans demonstrate efficient use of indexes, optimal join strategies, partition pruning where applicable, and predictable resource utilization.
- Filtering, sorting, aggregation, joins, pagination, and query structure are intentionally designed around actual workload characteristics rather than assumptions.
- Performance remains predictable under increasing data volume, concurrent users, evolving workloads, and infrastructure growth without requiring architectural redesign.
- Resource utilization balances CPU, memory, storage I/O, network bandwidth, cache efficiency, and transaction concurrency to maximize overall system throughput.
- Monitoring continuously identifies slow queries, execution regressions, locking behavior, resource consumption, timeout risks, and optimization opportunities.
- Documentation preserves business intent, optimization decisions, execution plans, indexing strategy, architectural trade-offs, and future maintenance guidance.
- Every optimization is validated through performance testing, correctness verification, regression analysis, and production readiness reviews before deployment.
- Engineering teams can confidently understand, maintain, extend, and optimize database queries without introducing hidden complexity or operational risk.
- The query optimization architecture consistently demonstrates correctness, efficiency, scalability, maintainability, observability, operational excellence, and long-term engineering maturity.

Exceptional query optimization is rarely recognized by users.

Applications simply respond instantly, infrastructure scales predictably, databases remain efficient under growing workloads, engineers understand why every query performs well, and performance becomes a deliberate outcome of thoughtful architecture rather than accidental optimization.
