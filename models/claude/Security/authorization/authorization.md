Authorization is not determining who a user is.

Authorization is the engineering discipline of determining what authenticated identities are permitted to access, modify, execute, or administer while enforcing least privilege, protecting business assets, and maintaining security, scalability, and operational simplicity.

Authorization answers one question:

**What is this authenticated identity allowed to do?**

# Definition of Done

An authorization system is considered complete when

- Protected resources, permission models, access policies, trust boundaries, privilege relationships, delegation rules, administrative controls, monitoring capabilities, and governance processes have been systematically designed using evidence-based security engineering principles.
- Authorization consistently enforces least privilege by validating every protected operation against explicit policies while preventing unauthorized access, privilege escalation, policy inconsistencies, excessive permissions, and operational misuse throughout the software lifecycle.
- Authorization architecture supports scalable growth, distributed systems, organizational expansion, maintainable engineering practices, reliable policy enforcement, continuous monitoring, operational resilience, sustainable governance, and long-term software evolution without introducing unnecessary complexity or technical debt.
- Engineering reviews validate permission accuracy, policy consistency, architectural integrity, documentation quality, maintainability, scalability, production readiness, operational resilience, auditability, and long-term engineering sustainability before deployment.
- Documentation clearly explains permission models, authorization flows, trust boundaries, policy decisions, engineering rationale, governance expectations, operational procedures, validation evidence, trade-offs, and future authorization improvements.
- Authorization decisions remain implementation-independent, vendor-neutral, measurable, reproducible, evidence-based, and applicable across evolving software architectures, organizational structures, infrastructure platforms, and future access control technologies.
- The resulting authorization system demonstrates engineering discipline, strong access control, predictable policy enforcement, resilient architecture, comprehensive auditability, operational excellence, maintainability, scalability, continuous observability, and sustainable software security throughout its lifetime.

Exceptional authorization is not measured by how many permissions exist.

It is measured by how precisely software grants only the access required, consistently enforces least privilege, protects business assets, withstands evolving threats, preserves operational simplicity, and continuously delivers secure, maintainable, and resilient access control throughout the lifetime of the software.
