# Purpose

This document defines engineering principles, secure software development methodologies, risk assessment frameworks, vulnerability prevention strategies, defensive engineering practices, and long-term best practices aligned with modern application security principles inspired by the OWASP philosophy.

It applies to

- Web Applications
- APIs
- SaaS Platforms
- Enterprise Applications
- Mobile Backends
- Cloud Applications
- Microservices
- Developer Platforms
- Production Software

Application security is not adding security after development.

Application security is the engineering discipline of systematically designing, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining software that continuously minimizes attack surfaces, prevents vulnerabilities, protects sensitive information, preserves business integrity, and maintains user trust throughout the software lifecycle.

Every engineering decision affects security.

# Definition of Done

A security architecture is considered complete when

- Assets, trust boundaries, attack surfaces, threats, vulnerabilities, operational risks, and recovery requirements have been systematically identified and evaluated using evidence-based engineering methodologies.
- Authentication, authorization, data protection, secure configuration, dependency management, secrets handling, monitoring, logging, and operational controls have been implemented according to secure engineering principles rather than reactive vulnerability remediation.
- Security architecture supports scalable growth, operational resilience, maintainable engineering practices, reliable incident response, sustainable governance, and long-term software evolution without introducing unnecessary complexity or technical debt.
- Engineering reviews validate security controls, architectural consistency, implementation quality, documentation completeness, maintainability, scalability, production readiness, operational resilience, and long-term engineering sustainability before deployment.
- Documentation clearly explains threat models, engineering rationale, architectural decisions, security controls, trade-offs, validation evidence, governance expectations, operational procedures, and future security improvements.
- Security decisions remain implementation-independent, vendor-neutral, measurable, reproducible, evidence-based, and applicable across evolving software systems, infrastructure platforms, and future technologies.
- The resulting software demonstrates engineering discipline, reduced attack surface, resilient architecture, predictable security behavior, operational excellence, maintainability, scalability, continuous observability, and sustainable software security throughout its lifetime.

Exceptional application security is not measured by the number of vulnerabilities that are fixed after deployment.

It is measured by how systematically software prevents vulnerabilities from being introduced, minimizes attack opportunities, preserves user trust, withstands evolving threats, and continuously delivers secure, reliable, and maintainable systems throughout the lifetime of the software.
