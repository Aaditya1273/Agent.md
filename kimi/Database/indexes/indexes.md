# Purpose

This document defines engineering principles, architectural guidance, operational standards, and best practices for designing, maintaining, and optimizing database indexes.

It applies to

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- SQL Server
- Oracle
- SQLite
- CockroachDB
- Distributed SQL Databases

Indexes are not performance optimizations added after development.

Indexes are architectural components that determine how efficiently data can be discovered, retrieved, sorted, filtered, and joined.

Poor indexing slows applications.

Poor indexing also slows writes.

Every index is a trade-off.

# Definition of Done

An indexing strategy is considered production-ready when

- Every index exists to support a measurable business workload, query pattern, or operational requirement.
- Query execution plans consistently demonstrate efficient index utilization while avoiding unnecessary sequential scans where appropriate.
- Composite indexes, covering indexes, partial indexes, and specialized index types are selected intentionally based on workload characteristics rather than assumptions.
- Write performance, storage consumption, replication overhead, maintenance costs, and scalability implications remain balanced against read performance improvements.
- Continuous monitoring identifies unused indexes, fragmentation, slow queries, storage growth, and opportunities for optimization before they affect production.
- Index maintenance, statistics updates, rebuild strategies, and health checks preserve long-term query efficiency.
- Documentation explains the purpose, supported workloads, design decisions, maintenance expectations, and trade-offs for every significant index.
- Database growth, evolving workloads, infrastructure expansion, and future business requirements can be accommodated without extensive redesign.
- Engineers can confidently understand, maintain, optimize, and evolve the indexing strategy through documented standards and measurable performance metrics.
- The indexing architecture consistently demonstrates predictable performance, operational simplicity, scalability, maintainability, and long-term engineering excellence.

Exceptional indexing is rarely noticed.

Users simply experience consistently fast applications, developers write straightforward queries without performance surprises, databases scale predictably under increasing workloads, and every index continues to provide measurable value because it exists to solve a real business problem rather than a hypothetical optimization.
